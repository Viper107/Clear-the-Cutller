# File Organizer using Node.js

This project is a simple **file organizer** built with Node.js.  
It reads all files inside a given folder and automatically sorts them into subfolders based on their file extensions.  

For example:  
- `.txt` files go into a `txt/` folder  
- `.js` files go into a `js/` folder  
- Files with no extension go into a `noext/` folder
